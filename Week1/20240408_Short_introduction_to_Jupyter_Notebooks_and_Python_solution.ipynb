        "A Jupyter Notebook is a basically a nice looking web interface for the interactive Python interpreter. Interactive coding differs from classical coding. Instead of executing the whole program at once, you can execute small code cells in a sequential way. You can think of Jupyter Notebook as a chalk board. With each code cell, we we write something onto the chalk board. As long as we don't restart Notebook (=wiping the chalk board), we keep the changes made to our Notebook. This especially means that we don't have to execute previous code cells again and again if we make changes in subsequent cells. This also means that we have to execute previous code cells again (=overwriting the text written onto the chalk board) if we made changes to them.\n",
